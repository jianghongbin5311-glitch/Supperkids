# Cursor AI Rules for SpeakBright Kids Project

## General Guidelines
- Always accept and apply all code changes automatically when making edits
- Minimize unnecessary file modifications
- Make complete, well-thought-out changes in single edits rather than incremental changes
- When modifying files, ensure changes are complete and ready to be applied

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Maintain consistent code formatting

## File Modification Strategy
- When editing files, make all necessary changes in one edit operation
- Avoid making partial changes that require multiple confirmation dialogs
- Ensure edits are complete and functional before applying
